small tools that help me

On my workstation I usually create a `tools` directory in `/opt` where I put all my small helpful tools for everyday work.

Then I add them to the PATH variable in `.bashrc`:

```.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/tools
```

shrinksize.sh

With my new mobile phone the camera pictures are really fat, far to big to be attached to an e-mail.

I use [shrinksize.sh](/shrinksize.sh) to decrease the quality of the jpegs.
